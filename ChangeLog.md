# Hike ChangeLog

## Unreleased

- Added `.gitignore` and `.ignore` support to the local file browser.
- Added CLI options for controlling local browser discovery, including root,
  hidden-file, ignore and exclude-glob handling.
- Added persistent discovery defaults to the configuration file, plus support
  for selecting an alternate config file with `--config`.
- Added explicit startup target handling so `hike <file>`, `hike <directory>`
  and `hike <url>` behave directly at launch.
- Added a `--command` option for preserving the old "run an internal command on
  startup" workflow.
- Refactored layout/state handling so screen orchestration and sidebar layout
  policy are separated.
- Added a smaller, auto-fitting navigation sidebar with width caps and
  responsive single-pane behaviour for narrow terminals.
- Added an explicit sidebar-view command and command-line shortcut to pair with
  the document/content jump commands.
- Added persistent configuration for sidebar sizing and responsive layout
  defaults.
- Added a switchable local browser flat-list mode with relative paths and
  persistent mode configuration.
- Stabilised the initial local browser root display so opening a directory does
  not briefly flash the absolute path before settling.
- Improved local tree sidebar sizing so deep nested paths can grow the sidebar
  up to the configured percentage-based cap.
- Added a `Taskfile.yml` workflow for validating, merging feature branches into
  `feature/all-requested-features`, and reinstalling the host tool from that
  branch.
- Migrated the CLI from ad hoc `argparse` handling to a structured Typer-based
  command tree with `open`, `config`, `schema`, `env`, `bindings`, and `themes`
  commands.
- Replaced the old dataclass/JSON configuration handling with typed
  `pydantic`/`pydantic-settings` models, YAML configuration files, schema
  export/validation commands, and environment-file support.
- Fixed sidebar focus handoff so the visible local browser receives focus
  instead of a hidden widget when opening directory-centric workflows.
- Flat-list local browser mode now hides empty directories that do not contain
  visible Markdown descendants.
- Removed the implicit `hike <target>` / `hike --command ...` TUI launch
  shortcut so launching the TUI now requires the explicit `hike open ...`
  command.
- Fixed the `Taskfile.yml` install verification step to use the new
  `hike bindings list` subcommand instead of the removed legacy flag.
- Fixed `hike config init --force` so legacy `configuration.json` files are
  migrated to the modern YAML config path instead of being overwritten with
  commented YAML content.
- Fixed CLI startup so root help/version and non-TUI commands no longer import
  the full Textual application stack at module import time.
- Added compatibility loading for broken legacy `.json` config files that
  contain YAML content from earlier typed-config builds.
